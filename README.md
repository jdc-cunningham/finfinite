# Finfinite
Some finance app

### Background
This is an app I designed in the past when I didn't know how to code. Mostly it's functionality vs. visual design. I'm building it in at least two stacks: Plain JS + LAMP and then ReactJS/Native with Django on the backend. The last part is ambitious, I have experience in them but I'm still at the "wall stage" where I have to keep looking up how to do things. Hence I'm building it in Plain JS + LAMP to have some momentum. See Wiki for updates.
